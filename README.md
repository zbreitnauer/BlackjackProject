# BlackjackProject

# Description
* Blackjack is a classic card game. The idea of the game is to get close to 21 as possible without going over "bust" or at least having a hand higher than the opposing player.

# How to play
* Once the app starts you will have the option to play the game with a simple "Y" or "N" command. Continuing will deal you two cards and two cards to the dealer. It is up to you to decide whether or not you will (1) "Hit" meaning add another card or "Stay" keeping the cards you have. It will then be the dealers turn to draw. If the dealer doesn't get a higher score or goes over 21, YOU WIN!!! 

# Lessons learned
* Lessons learned with this project were complex multiple classes/methods. Along with the classes were abstracts, encapsulations, inheritance, interface and enums. Also lessons I need to learn are UMLs and the logic/formula behind the methods. Had a hard time trying to find a starting point.
